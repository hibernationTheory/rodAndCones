            "motivation":"I actively develop tools to enhance the productivity and efficiency of myself and my teammates. I believe solving problems for even secondary concerns in 3d software applications such as accessiblity, improves the user experience considerably.",
            "technique":"I use Python as my main language and the PyQt Framework to develop the interfaces for the tools - the host application permitting. Likewise I use PyQt to build studio-wide desktop applications. Tools are built with good coding practices and scalability in mind.",
            "furtherDiscussion":"I believe automating repetitive processes doesn't take away from artists duties but actually leave a larger room for them to exercise their creativity. In my mind any redundant step in a repetitive production process that can be automated should be done so."
