          <outline text="Angular seems awesome. But it is too polarizing and undependable to have a higher rating. Also it's popularity in decline due to new contenders in the MVC playfield and drastic changes that Angular 2.0 is bringing to the table. Definitely not a core competency but very good to have due to wealth of projects out there that is utilizing it." /></outline>
        <outline text="Description" >
          <outline text="AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. Angular's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology." /></outline>
        <outline text="Reason" >
          <outline text="There is a strong market incentive for learning Angular. Being the trendy front-end framework of late times, there are lots of projects out there utilizing it. Also it really makes it easy to create data bound elements removing the need for some laborious and repetitive front end coding." /></outline>

          <outline text="Django is one of the capable frameworks that makes web development accessible for Python programmers. Branding itself as the framework 'for perfectionists with deadlines' it allows for quick realization of web application ideas online. Even though some other backend frameworks seems to gather more prominence lately (such as express built on Node.js) Django still delivers a great development experience. At a very fundamental level it represents baseline of a back-end knowledge for developers that started out with it and hence it puts all other new ideas in context as they get introduced." /></outline>

        <outline text="Plan" >
          <outline text="It is relatively easy to acquire the foundation knowledge in Bootstrap. It almost relies on your ability to recall correct class names from memory rather than understanding intricate ideas or concepts. Practice would make you better in deriving what might be the best practices while working with it. If any time is to be spent to develop a deeper understanding of the framework one should primarily focus on the 'grid system' it provides since that proves to be the most useful aspect of it. You should also watch couple of conference videos to understand the higher level concepts, practices or concerns that surrounds Bootstrap. Since applying Bootstrap knowledge is so much reliant of memorizing rather than learning, one should carefully assess which parts of the framework is actually worth learning and holds value in terms of knowledge." /></outline>

              <outline text="The stated prerequisite for CS 121 is not CS 20, but &quot;experience in formal mathematics at the level of Computer Science 20.&quot;  Accordingly, you do not actually need to know all the material covered in CS 20; graphs, boolean formulas, growth rates of functions and the like may come up in a few lectures or homework problems, but not so much that you would not be able to pick those up as you go along." />
              <outline text="What's important is that you have some &quot;mathematical maturity.&quot;  Most of the problems on the problem sets ask you to write formal mathematical proofs, and there are a lot of proofs by induction.  We also give formal definitions of different objects (finite-state automata, context-free grammars, Turing machines and the like); you need to be able to go from the formal definition to an intuitive understanding so that you can solve problems that involve manipulating those objects in some way.  If you're not familiar with formal mathematics in this way, you might want to take CS 20, or you should expect to put in some extra time (particularly at the beginning of the course)." />
              <outline text="As far as doing well, the same advice as for any other course applies:  Try to understand the material as you go along, and make use of the professor's and teaching fellows' office hours, your peers in the class, the course Piazza, textbook, and other resources.  The course does get somewhat more difficult as the semester progresses, so if you're struggling before the add-drop deadline (or if you're not sure whether to take the course in the first place), consider telling the professor or TFs about your specific background and they'll be able to give more personalized advice." /></outline>

          <outline text="Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development methodology for managing product development. It defines &quot;a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal&quot;, challenges assumptions of the &quot;traditional, sequential approach&quot; to product development, and enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members and disciplines in the project." /></outline>
