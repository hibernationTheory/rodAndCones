        <outline text="Description" >
          <outline text="AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. Angular's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology." /></outline>
        <outline text="Reason" >
          <outline text="There is a strong market incentive for learning Angular. Being the trendy front-end framework of late times, there are lots of projects out there utilizing it. Also it really makes it easy to create data bound elements removing the need for some laborious and repetitive front end coding. It can almost said to make development fun. Except that it apparently doesn't. As web applications get more demanding and complex the behind the scenes magic of Angular is said to become an impediment." /></outline>
        <outline text="Summary" >
          <outline text="To Be Summarized. We thrive because of our immersive proposition and best-of-breed team player culture. We aim to conservatively connect our cloud by globally monetizing our actionable mobile dot-bombs. Going forward, our wholesale silo will deliver value to visibilities. Going forward, our best-in-class synergy will deliver value to market foci." /></outline>
        <outline text="Rating" >
          <outline text="6.8" />
          <outline text="In my opinion Angular seems awesome. But it is too polarizing and undependable to have a higher rating. Also it's popularity in decline due to new contenders and drastic changes that Angular 2.0 is bringing to the table. Definitely not a core competency but very good to have due to wealth of projects out there that is utilizing it." /></outline>
        <outline text="Status" >
          <outline text="Active" />
          <outline text="Try to utilize it in your projects but also try to avoid going too deep into it. The primary reason being the imminent launch of Angular 2.0, which is changing the framework in very fundamental ways." /></outline>

        <outline text="Reason" >
          <outline text="Django is the framework that I have entered the world of web development with. To me it is a platform that gives me the opportunity to quickly deploy ideas online. Also being the baseline of my backend knowledge, it frames all the other new ideas for me as they get introduced.

              <outline text="The stated prerequisite for CS 121 is not CS 20, but &quot;experience in formal mathematics at the level of Computer Science 20.&quot;  Accordingly, you do not actually need to know all the material covered in CS 20; graphs, boolean formulas, growth rates of functions and the like may come up in a few lectures or homework problems, but not so much that you would not be able to pick those up as you go along." />
              <outline text="What's important is that you have some &quot;mathematical maturity.&quot;  Most of the problems on the problem sets ask you to write formal mathematical proofs, and there are a lot of proofs by induction.  We also give formal definitions of different objects (finite-state automata, context-free grammars, Turing machines and the like); you need to be able to go from the formal definition to an intuitive understanding so that you can solve problems that involve manipulating those objects in some way.  If you're not familiar with formal mathematics in this way, you might want to take CS 20, or you should expect to put in some extra time (particularly at the beginning of the course)." />
              <outline text="As far as doing well, the same advice as for any other course applies:  Try to understand the material as you go along, and make use of the professor's and teaching fellows' office hours, your peers in the class, the course Piazza, textbook, and other resources.  The course does get somewhat more difficult as the semester progresses, so if you're struggling before the add-drop deadline (or if you're not sure whether to take the course in the first place), consider telling the professor or TFs about your specific background and they'll be able to give more personalized advice." /></outline>
