It defines \"a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal\", challenges assumptions of the \"traditional, sequential approach\" to product development, and enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members and disciplines in the project.",
