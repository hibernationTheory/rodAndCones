#### Summary

Ever since I have decided to write a short summary for the books I have read, I have been waiting to finish this one book to start with the endeavour. It makes sense if you think about it. A book that promises to teach you 'How to Read a Book' should ideally be a prerequisite to all the other reading you would be doing. So I wanted to prioritize summarizing it to be able internalize its message before I end up reading more books in my old - and possibly misguided - ways. Imagine the disappointment I had when I discovered this title relatively later in my life. Even though I feel like I have grown a lot with the books I have read, it is hard not to think all your prior readings as wasted efforts since - according to this book - you might have not known how to properly read back then.

This book talks a great deal about the act of reading, the types of reading there are, how to perform each of those types of reading and what to expect from them. It almost goes into textbook detail for a subject that appears to be quite straightforward, unless of course you are illiterate. It is mostly primarily concerned about non-fiction books and making sure to absorb the idea(s) that the author is trying to convey while reading those.

Since I started to use ebook readers, I have became somewhat of a serial book reader. As this digital device solved some of the accessibility issues I had with reading (such as having the collection of books you are reading available to you all the times without its full weight toll) my consumption of books increased substantially. So initially I was initially very attracted to the premise of this title. It was sad to see myself not having the patience to even finish reading it. Even though it delivers some valuable ideas and things to keep in mind while reading a work of nonfiction, I found this exhaustive account of "reading" to be immensely boring. Maybe this is a good book that I discovered too late. Reading about the categories of books there are, how to identify them, what particular steps you might take when trying to refine ideas is something that I am - more or less - doing subconsciously at this point so hundreds of pages that are dedicated to the subject doesn't validate the effort involved in digging the gold here for me.

I would recommend this book if you are someone obsessed with the idea of doing it "right", don't mind spending your time learning the very basics of anything or getting advanced knowledge in things that are supposedly basic and have a higher threshold for the boredom that comes with the statements of obvious. 

Here are some of my takeaways from the book:

- If you don't feel the sense of wonder or puzzlement when you are reading, it means that you are not learning anything new, what you reading doesn't add anything to you. Mainstream news are usually of this nature.

- Books are fascinating in a way that you can sometimes interface with an author that has much more understanding than you do about a given subject. If you can converge on her language and what she is trying to communicate, there is a chance that you can reach the same level of understanding as the author, and increase the depths of your knowledge. In short you can get 'enlightened'.

- > "an abecedarian ignorance that precedes knowledge, and a doctoral ignorance that comes after it." - Montaigne

- Reading books is not a passive act. Just like there is no inactive learning, there is no inactive reading.

- There are four levels of reading with each subsequent level improving on and including the level that precedes it. Most people end up getting stuck at the first level of reading - Elementary Reading -, where you can read and write but you can't necessarily synthesize the communication intended in the written word. These levels are increasingly harder where final level of reading, called 'syntopical reading', is the most complex and systematic type of reading that you can do. 

- The second level of reading is skimming. The title, introduction and table of contents serve an actual purpose for a book. Use them to your advantage as you are skimming a book and trying to synthesize what a book might be about. When assessing a book feel free to dive into it, read random paragraphs, checkout chapters that seem pivotal or promising. These are all valid methods that you have in your disposal when trying to build an initial mental model of a prospective book.

- This was one my favorite suggestions from the book as I find myself constantly doing it with a certain amount of guilt up until now: When tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever stopping. Don't be blocked by parts that you don't initially understand. If you stumble upon the block, you will get distracted and lost. 
> "In most cases, you will not be able to puzzle the thing out by sticking to it. You will have a much better chance of understanding it on a second reading, but that requires you to have read the book through at least once. ... And even if you never go back, understanding half of a really tough book is much better than not understanding it at all, which will be the case if you allow yourself to be stopped by the first difficult passage you come to."

- The third level of reading is called active reading, which involves actively thinking about the content that is being delivered to you. There are four questions that you need to ask to the book you are reading to get engaged with it in a more active manner:
	- What is the book as a whole?
	- What is being said in detail and how?
	- Is the book true, in whole or part.
	- What of it? (the significance of the information that the author is delivering)
  Trying to answer these questions about any book that you are reading is going to make you a better reader.

- There are also rules of analytical reading. They are:
	- You must know what kind of a book you are reading. (Practical / Theoretical, etc...) 
	- State the unity of the whole book in a single sentence or a short paragraph .This is a valuable thing to do with almost every book you read and forms the basis of my reasoning in summarizing books as well. Unity must be expressed shortly. "If it requires too many words, you have not seen the unity but a multiplicity."
	- Set the major parts of the book and show how these sections are organized into creating the unity. It is worth noting that only a few book you will be reading will deserve this kind of an effort. But developing this kind of an understanding would help you synthesize the information in the book.
	- Find out what the author's problems where.
	- Find important words in the book and come to terms with the author in usage of them. Some words might be loaded with different kind of a meaning in a book. It is important to make sure you understand the true intent of a word to be able to understand the ideas that are being communicated.
