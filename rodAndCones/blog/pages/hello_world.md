# Oh Hai World!

Blogging is one of the least sustainable activities you can involve yourself in your digital existence. It is rather interesting to see how much we have got to say online - given our social media tendencies - yet lack the discipline to do it in a consistent manner. For the developer kind another problem exists apart from failing to blog sustainably: Deciding to build your blogging platform from scratch on which you will most likely fail to blog. A wasted effort of a terrible kind: even it succeeds, it succeeds to waste more effort.

Having said that I recently ended up completing my blog from scratch. I did undertake the task as a part of my commitment to my personal development through side projects. The platform is Jekyll-like. I write up a file in markdown syntax which the backend renders as a page in HTML. There are still to-do's technically but I am ready to be blogging in which I will most likely fail - statistically speaking.

Now that the easy part of blogging is almost over, I am looking for suggestions from those who have succeeded in blogging consistently (I know you are a rare kind) How do you manage, are there any tips or considerations to make to be able to blog consistently and coherently? How do you make it worthwhile your time and effort? This is an open ended posting for a very personal project, just feel free to get in touch if you are the writer type.

Oh by the way, another problem with building your blogging platform from scratch? You get lazy when it gets to implementing the Comments section. Hopefully you know how to reach me.
