>Consider a superintelligent agent with actuators connected to a nanotech assembler. Such an agent is already powerful enough to overcome any natural obstacles to its indefinite survival. Faced with no intelligent opposition, such an agent could plot a safe course of development that would lead to its acquiring the complete inventory of technologies that would be useful to the attainment of its goals. For example, it could develop the technology to build and launch Von Neumann probes, machines capable of interstellar travel that can use resources such as asteroids, planets and stars to make copies of themselves. By launching one Von Neumann probe, the agent could thus initiate an open-ended process of space colonization. The replicating probe's descendants, travelling at some significant fraction of the speed of light, would end up colonizing a substantial portion of the Hubble volume, the part of the expanding universe that is theoretically accessible from where we are now.
